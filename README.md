This is the code for a project for my Codecademy class. I created the home page for a pet rescue website using flexbox.
This project has no direct association with ADORE Pet Rescue and was simply done as a practice exercise for Codecademy.
You can view the final version of this project here by using a desktop/laptop: https://reneer11.github.io/.
